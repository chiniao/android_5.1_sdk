Provides model support for extending the base installation
and update services.
<h2>
Package Specification</h2>
This package provides a convenience implementation of the default model
objects and parsers used for writing pluggable support of alternate feature
packaging schemes and update site access mechanisms. In general, most developers
do not need to directly use the classes defined in this package. Instead,
they can use the corresponding derived implementation classes contained
in package <b>org.eclipse.update.core</b>.
<p>Classes in this package would typically only be used directly when writing
and alternate set of model objects for a feature and type implementation.
<p>
<b>Note:</b> This package has been deprecated and will be deleted in a future
release.  See bug 311590 for details.
