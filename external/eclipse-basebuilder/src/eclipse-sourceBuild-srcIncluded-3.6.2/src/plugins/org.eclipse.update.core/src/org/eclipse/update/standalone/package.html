Provides support for performing various install/update operations from the command line.
<h2>
Package Specification</h2>
This package contains interfaces for performing update/install operations 
without using the Update Manager user interface. In general, it is best to use these
classes for command line invocation, but it is possible to also use them programmatically.
<p>
<b>Note:</b> This package has been deprecated and will be deleted in a future
release.  See bug 311590 for details.
