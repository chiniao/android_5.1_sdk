<H1>Working with projects, folders and files</H1>

<p>There are three different types of resources in the workbench: projects, folders,
and files.  Projects are the largest structural unit used by the Workbench. Projects contain
folders and files, and they can be opened, closed, or built. Folders can contain other folders 
and files. The Workbench provides a number of mechanisms for working with projects, folders 
and files.  See the related tasks section for more details.
</p>
<p>
Folders and files can be linked to locations in the file system
outside of the project's location.  These special folders and files are called
