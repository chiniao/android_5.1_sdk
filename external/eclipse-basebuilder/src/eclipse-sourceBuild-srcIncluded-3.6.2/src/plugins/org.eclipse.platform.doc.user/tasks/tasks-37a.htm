<h1>Scheduling automatic updates</h1>
<p>You can configure Eclipse update to search for updates to the installed features 
on a periodic basis automatically. You can configure how these updates
are scheduled and performed from the <b>Install/Update &gt; Automatic Updates</b> preference page.
</p>
<h3>Scheduling options</h3>
<p>Each time an Eclipse-based product starts, the update scheduler will
activate based on the chosen scheduling. You can choose between the following
update policies:</p>
<ul>
  <li>No automatic search</li>
  <li>On each startup (default)</li>
  <li>Every day at a specific time (i.e. 3:00PM) *</li>
  <li>On a scheduled day of the week at a specific time (i.e. Monday 8:00AM) *</li>
</ul>
<p>* assuming the application is active. If the application is not active at a 
scheduled time and the search is past due, it will immediately start on the next 
startup</p>
<h3>Download options</h3>
<p>Scheduling options define when searches are performed but do not 
define what actually happens when updates are found. Download options 
control this behavior (this set of options is disabled if automatic search is 
turned off). You can choose between:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Search for updates and notify  when they are available (default)</li>
  <li>Download new updates automatically and notify  when ready to install them</li>
</ul>
<p>In both cases, the update scheduler will execute in the background 
when necessary based on the scheduling options. There will be no messages if no 
updates are found. If there are updates, the behavior will depend on the 
chosen download option.</p>
<h4>Search and notify</h4>
<p>If search only is selected, a message box will open to notify you when updates
are found:</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">New updates have been found for this product. Do you want to 
download them?</font></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">[Yes] [No] </font></p>
<p>If <b>Yes</b> is pressed, an update wizard will show a list of detected updates. The 
same wizard is used when you search for updates manually using
<a class="command-link" href='javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.update.findAndInstallUpdates")'>
<img src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/command_link.png">
<b>Help &gt; Software Updates &gt; Find and Install...</b></a>.</p>
<p>If <b>No</b> is pressed, the dialog closes and the updates are ignored.</p>
<h4>Download new updates</h4>
<p>If the second option has been selected (download updates automatically), the 
search will be scheduled as before, but when new updates are found, the 
download will commence immediately. When all the features have been successfully 
downloaded, a different message box will show up:</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">New updates have been found and downloaded. Do you want to install them?</font></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">[Yes] [No] </font></p>
<p>If <b>No</b> is pressed, the dialog will close and no updates will occur.
If <b>Yes</b> is pressed, installation of the new updates will proceed.</p>
<p>If you choose not to install the downloaded features, but later launch the 
<b>Help &gt; Find and Install...</b> wizard for updating, the downloaded files will be reused, 
unless there are newer versions on the server or you have restarted eclipse. </p>
