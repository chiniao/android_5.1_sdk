<h1>Updating features with the update manager</h1>

<p>To check to see whether there are updates for a product's existing features
  (requires Internet access):
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click
  <a class="command-link" href='javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.update.findAndInstallUpdates")'>
  <img src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/command_link.png">
  <b>Help &gt; Software Updates &gt; Find and Install...</b></a> and select the 
  first choice (search for updates). This will contact 
    the Web sites associated with the product's features to discover what versions 
    of those features are available. The potential upgrades are presented in on 
  the next page.</li>
  <li>Select the feature versions that you wish to upgrade, and click <b>Next</b>.</li>
  <li>Carefully review the license agreements for the upgraded features. If the 
    terms of all these licenses are acceptable, check &quot;I accept the terms 
    in the license agreements.&quot; Do not proceed to download the features if 
    the license terms are not acceptable.</li>
  <li><p>Feature versions can be digitally signed by the company that provides them. 
    This allows you to verify more easily that the features and plug-ins 
    that are about to be downloaded and installed are coming from a trusted supplier. </p><br>
    <p><b>Warning:</b> Because of the possibility of harmful or even malicious plug-ins, 
    you should only download features from parties that you trust. </p><br><p>Click 
    <b>Install</b> to allow the downloading and installing to proceed.</p></li>
  <li>Once all the features and plug-ins have been downloaded successfully and 
    their files installed into the product on the local computer, a new configuration 
    that incorporates these features and plug-ins will be formulated. Click <b>Yes</b> 
    when asked to exit and restart the Workbench for the changes to take effect.</li>
