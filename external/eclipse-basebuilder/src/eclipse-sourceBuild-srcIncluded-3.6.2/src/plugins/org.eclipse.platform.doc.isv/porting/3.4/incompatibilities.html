<h1>Incompatibilities between Eclipse 3.3 and 3.4</h1>

<p>
  Eclipse changed in incompatible ways between 3.3 and 3.4 in ways that affect 
  plug-ins. The following entries describe the areas that changed and provide 
  instructions for migrating 3.3 plug-ins to 3.4. Note that you only need to look 
  here if you are experiencing problems running your 3.3 plug-in on 3.4.

<h2>1. <a name="FileEditorInput">FileEditorInput#getPath throws IllegalArgumentException for non local files</a></h2>
<p><strong>What is affected:</strong> Clients that call getPath() on FileEditorInput.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong>In release 3.3 and earlier, <code>FileEditorInput#getPath</code>
returned <code>null</code> when called on an input whose file was not in the local
file system.  This violated the contract of <code>IPathEditorInput#getPath</code> which
did not allow a null result. The method now throws <code>IllegalArgumentException</code>
in this case. The convenience method <code>FileEditorInput#isLocalFile</code>
has been added so that callers who are unsure of the state of a supplied <code>IFile</code> can check
before calling <code>#getPath</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Action required:</strong> Clients that call <code>FileEditorInput#getPath</code>
should check if they are calling it on an input that is not in the local file system, and react
accordingly.</p>
<!-- ############################################## -->
<h2>2. <a name="ModifyRule">Changed scheduling rules for IProject#setDescription</a></h2>
<p><strong>What is affected:</strong> Clients that call <code>IProject#setDescription</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> In the 3.3 release, all calls to <code>IProject#setDescription</code>
required the caller to own <code>IResourceRuleFactory#modifyRule</code>, which
was implemented with the <code>IWorkspaceRoot</code> scheduling rule.  This was
too restrictive in most cases, and unnecessarily prevented other threads from modifying 
other projects in the workspace while <code>modifyRule</code> was held.  In the 3.4
release, the <code>IWorkspaceRoot</code> scheduling rule is now only needed when configuring project
natures: clients calling <code>IProject#setDescription</code> without the <code>AVOID_NATURE_CONFIG</code>
flag.  <code>IResourceRuleFactory#modifyRule</code> now only locks the project resource by default, allowing
more concurrency when opening or closing projects, or when setting the description but
not configuring project natures.</p>
<p><strong>Action required:</strong> Clients calling <code>IProject#setDescription</code>
should ensure they own the correct scheduling rule. See the API javadoc for a description
of what rules are required for this and other workspace operations.</p>
<!-- ############################################## -->
<h2>3. <a name="MarkersAdditions">Markers views no longer support additions entries</a></h2>
<p><strong>What is affected:</strong> Clients adding to the Problems, Tasks or Markers Views using <code>IWorkbenchActionConstants.MB_ADDITIONS</code></p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The Problems, Tasks or Markers Views no longer have an entry
 for <code>IWorkbenchActionConstants.MB_ADDITIONS</code> as the pop-up and view menus are now all commands
 based. </p>
<p><strong>Action required:</strong> Additions to these views can be made using the <code>org.eclipse.ui.menus</code> extension point.</p>
<!-- ############################################## -->
<h2>4. <a name="TomcatRemoved">org.eclipse.tomcat no longer included</a></h2>
<p><strong>What is affected:</strong> Any RCP application with a dependency on the org.eclipse.tomcat plugin. </p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Up to and including Eclipse 3.2 the help system used a Tomcat server and included the plug-in org.eclipse.tomcat.  
Since Eclipse 3.3 the help system no longer uses Tomcat and instead uses the Equinox web server. In Eclipse 3.4 org.eclipse.tomcat was removed
from platform and sdk builds.</p>
<p><strong>Action required:</strong> Remove any dependencies to org.eclipse.tomcat. If you need a web server use 
the Equinox server defined in org.eclipse.equinox.http.jetty.</p>
<!-- ############################################## -->
<h2>5. <a name="TabbedProperties">Corrected API for tabbed properties view to not require the usage of internal types</a></h2>
<p><strong>What is affected:</strong> Clients calling <code>TabbedPropertySheetPage.getCurrentTab()</code>,
 overriding <code>TabbedPropertySheetPage.updateTabs()</code>, or implementing <code>ITabSelectionListener</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The above mentioned methods and types were not usable because they required clients
 to refer to internal, non-API types. To fix the leakage of internal types, methods were removed/renamed in a binary
  incompatible way. For details, please refer to bug 224390. </p>
<p><strong>Action required:</strong> Clients who were referring to internal non-API types to make use of the mentioned
methods and types will have to be updated to refer to the cleaned up API. Plug-ins that need to work against both versions
3.3 and 3.4 will have to use reflection to protect themselves from the binary incompatibilities.</p>
