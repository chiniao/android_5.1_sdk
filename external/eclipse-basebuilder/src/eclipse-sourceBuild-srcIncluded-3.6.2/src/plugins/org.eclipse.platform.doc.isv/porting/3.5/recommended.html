<h2>1. <a name="ContentAssistAction">Delete creation of ContentAssistAction action</a></h2>
<p>
As of 3.5, the <code>AbstractTextEditor</code> creates and registers the content assist action. This means that subclasses no longer need to create and register their own content assist action.
It is recommended to remove that code and to use <code>org.eclipse.ui.texteditor.ITextEditorActionConstants.CONTENT_ASSIST</code> when adding that action to the main menu or toolbar.
</p><p>
Same applies to the action that shows content assist context information (<code>org.eclipse.ui.texteditor.ITextEditorActionConstants.CONTENT_ASSIST_CONTEXT_INFORMATION</code>).
</p>

<h2>2. <a name="NewFilteredTreeLook">Switch to new look of FilteredTree</a></h2>
<p>
As of 3.5, the <code>FilteredTree</code> comes with a new look. It is recommended to switch to that new look by using one of the two new constructors. Subclasses that switch to the
new look must carefully review their UI because depending on what the subclass does, it might result in a broken look. In that case, the code in the subclass needs to be adjusted.
