<h2><a name="overviewRulerAnnotationColor">Why are my annotations in the editor's overview ruler no longer discolored?</a></h2>
<p>
As of 3.4, temporary annotations are no longer discolored in the editor's overview ruler. There were many complaints
that the color was computed by discoloring the color set on the <b>General &gt; Editors &gt; Text Editors &gt; Annotations</b> preference page. Clients that nevertheless
want to stick to the old behavior can use <code>org.eclipse.jface.text.source.OverviewRuler.OverviewRuler(IAnnotationAccess, int, ISharedTextColors, boolean)</code>
to create the overview ruler.

<h2><a name="IDELTK">What happened to in-place Rename in the Project Explorer?</a></h2>
<p>
The IDE global actions for Delete, Rename, and Move now use LTK so they can
participate in the refactoring support.  These actions now open the refactoring
dialog which includes the preview button.  These actions will revert to their
old behaviour if shipped without LTK support.

<h2><a name="cvsPasswordManagment">What happened to my saved CVS passwords?</a></h2>
<p>
The passwords stored with the CVS integration would have to be re-entered as the
CVS client switched to a new secure storage back end. On the plus side, the CVS 
integration now stores passwords in an encrypted form.
