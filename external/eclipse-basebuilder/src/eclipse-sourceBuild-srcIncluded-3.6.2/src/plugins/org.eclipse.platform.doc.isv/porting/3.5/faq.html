<h2><a name="noextendApiRestriction">Why is the @noextend API restriction supported on interfaces? </a></h2>
<p>In release 3.4, API tooling supported one   restriction for API interfaces - <code>@noimplement</code>. This restriction specified   an interface was not to be implemented or extended by clients. To enrich API specifications, Eclipse 3.5 separates these concerns into   two restrictions - <code>@noimplement</code> and <code>@noextend</code>. This allows an interface to   be extended when it is not to be implemented directly. For   example, a clients may be permitted to subclass an existing implementation of a <code>@noimplement</code> interface and extend the base   interface with extra function.</p>
<p>Component owners need to decide where to add <code>@noextend</code> tags on existing   interfaces.    To maintain exactly the same API contract as specified in 3.4, <code>@noextend</code> tags   can be added to all interfaces specified as <code>@noimplement</code>. This   can be decided on a case by case basis. Generally, the <code>@noextend</code> restriction can be   omitted, as clients that extend and implement a <code>@noimplement</code> interface   will still be flagged with errors. However, if you would like to reserve   the right to add constants (public static final fields) to an API   interface in the future, you must add the <code>@noextend</code> tag. This is because   adding a field to an interface is binary incompatible if clients can   extend or implement an interface (see <A href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Evolving_Java-based_APIs_2#Evolving_API_Interfaces">Evolving API Interfaces</A>).   Adding an API restriction to a class/interface is usually an error -   however, API tooling allows you to add <code>@noextend</code> tags without penalty in   the 3.5 release, since this specifies the same contract that 3.4 tooling provided. If you were   to wait until a later release to add the additional tag, and error would   be generated to indicate a restriction has been added to an API interface. </p>
