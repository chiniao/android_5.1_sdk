<h2>Plug-ins and fragments</h2>
<p>Features are described in terms of the plug-ins that comprise them.&nbsp;
This means that plug-ins are the fundamental unit for packaging
function.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>While features are organized for the purposes of distributing and updating
products, plug-ins are organized to facilitate the development of the product
functionality among the product team.&nbsp; The development team determines when to
carve up program functionality into a separate plug-in.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plug-ins are packaged in a <a href="../reference/misc/plugin_archive.html">plug-in
archive</a> file and described using a <a href="../reference/misc/plugin_manifest.html">plug-in
manifest file</a>, <b>plugin.xml</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plug-in <b>fragments</b> are separately packaged files whose contents are
treated as if they were in the original plug-in archive file.&nbsp; They are
useful for adding plug-in functionality, such as additional national language
translations, to an existing plug-in after it has been installed.&nbsp;
Fragments are ideal for shipping functionality that may trail the initial product
release, since they can be used to add functionality without repackaging or
reinstalling the original plug-in.&nbsp; When a fragment is detected by the
platform, its contents are merged with the functionality in the original
plug-in.&nbsp; In other words, if you query the platform plug-in registry, you
would see the extensions and other functionality provided in the fragment as if it
was in the original plug-in.</p>
<p>Fragments are described using a fragment manifest file, <b>fragment.xml.</b>&nbsp;
It is similar to the plug-in manifest file.&nbsp; Since a fragment shares many
properties with its plug-in, some attributes in the plug-in manifest are not
valid, such as the plug-in class and plug-in imports.</p>
