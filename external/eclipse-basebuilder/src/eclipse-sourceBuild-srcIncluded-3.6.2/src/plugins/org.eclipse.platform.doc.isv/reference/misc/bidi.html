<title>Supporting bidirectional text</title>

<h1>Supporting bidirectional text</h1>
<p>A bidirectional language is one that can write either right to left or left to 
right based on context. Bidirectional text is supported throughout the platform.
Eclipse will recognize Hebrew, Arabic, Farsi and Urdu as bidirectional by default.</p>
<h2>Enabling Bidirectional Support</h2>
<p>The orientation of the workbench is determined in one of the following ways 
  (in order of priority):</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>-dir command line parameter</strong>. If the -dir command line option 
    is used this will be the default orientation. Valid values are -dir rtl or -dir ltr.</li>
  <li><strong>system properties</strong>. If the system property <tt>eclipse.orientation</tt> 
    is set this will be used. The recognized values of this property are the same as
    the -dir command line argument.</li>
  <li><strong>-nl command line parameter</strong>. If the -nl option is used and 
    the language is Hebrew, Arabic, Farsi or Urdu the orientation will be right 
    to left.</li>
  <li>Failing all of the above, the platform defaults to a left to right orientation.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In JFace, the orientation can be determined by calling 
<b>org.eclipse.jface.Window#getDefaultOrientation()</b>.  Standalone JFace
applications must set the default orientation by calling 
<b>org.eclipse.jface.Window#setDefaultOrientation()</b>, otherwise it
will assume a default value of <b>SWT.NONE</b>. The default orientation is 
set automatically when running the Workbench.  All subclasses of <tt>org.eclipse.jface.Window</tt>
inherit this default orientation.</p>
<p>Views and editors inherit the window orientation from their 
  parent. Dialogs should inherit orientation by using the shell style of their 
  superclass by calling <b>super.getShellStyle()</b> when creating or configuring their shell.</p>

  perspective in English</strong></p>
<h2>Enabling Text Processing</h2>
<p>The orientation of the workbench is independant of the special case processing 
  for bidirectional languages. If the language of the current Locale is Hebrew, 
  Arabic, Farsi or Urdu text processing will be enabled. Text processing is used 
  to handle special case characters that should not be processed as birdirectional 
  text such as path seperators. See <code>org.eclipse.osgi.util.TextProcessor</code> 
  for more details. </p>
<h2>Enabling your plug-in for looking up alternate icons</h2>
<p>In many cases your icons will not make any sense in right to left mode. In 
  particular any icon to do with editing will have this issue.To enable lookup 
  of images in a fragment, use $nl$ in your icon path and use
  the <b>org.eclipse.core.runtime.FileLocator</b> class to find icons at runtime.
</p>
<p>For example</p>
<pre>
   String iconPath = &quot;$nl$/icons/myicon.gif&quot;;
   URL url = FileLocator.find( Platform.getBundle(MyPluginId), new Path(iconPath), null);
   Image Descriptor descriptor = ImageDescriptor.createFromURL(url);
</pre>
<p>
  If the icon reference is in your <tt>plugin.xml</tt> file, make sure you have the $nl$ 
  prefix on your path and the lookup will be handled for you. If you define your
  own extension points that involve icons, be sure to load images in the same way.
</p>
<h3>How to choose icons to override</h3>
<p>There are no hard and fast rules for determining what icons need to be overridden
in a right to left language.  In general, focus on icons that imply a textual direction with a 
horizontal arrow.</p>
