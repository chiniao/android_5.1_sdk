To launch eclipse you may need to disable file locking using the osgi.locking property. For example, you could launch eclipse as follows:

"eclipse -vmargs -Dosgi.locking=none".

Otherwise, eclipse may fail to create a lock file with reason: "Workspace in use or cannot be created, choose a different one."
